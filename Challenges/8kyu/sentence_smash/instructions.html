<div class="markdown prose max-w-5xl mx-auto overflow-x-auto break-words" id="description"><h1 id="sentence-smash">Sentence Smash</h1>
<p>Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. <strong>Be careful, there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!</strong></p>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<pre><code>['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =&gt;  'hello world this is great'
</code></pre>
