NASM is a fun and easy to learn variant of ASM. If you are interested in writing your first NASM programs, you can use this Kata as an entrypoint.</p>
<p>The goal of this Kata is very, very easy to accomplish in other programming languages and it is in NASM as well.
It's whole purpose is to give you a feeling on how to write a program in NASM to complete Katas for it on this site.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function, that will take two arguments of type integer and returns the one that is the largest. If both numbers are equal, return the equal number. The numbers will never be negative and will not be greater than 2000.</p>
<p>What you need to know:</p>
<p>The first argument is stored in <code>rdi/edi</code>.</p>
<p>The second argument is stored in <code>rsi/esi</code>.</p>
<p>The return value needs to be stored in <code>rax/eax</code>.</p>
<p>To tell the program to exit and return the value stored in <code>rax/eax</code> you need to write <code>ret</code></p>
<p>Have fun coding :)</p>
